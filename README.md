## 🎯 Overview

Syn³ introduces a novel neural architecture that operates across three dimensions of synthesis:

- **Syn¹**: Document synthesis through advanced encoding
- **Syn²**: Cross-document synergy via attention mechanisms  
- **Syn³**: Synopsis generation through hierarchical decoding

Unlike traditional summarization models that process documents independently, Syn³ learns rich relationships between multiple documents to generate coherent, comprehensive summaries.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Input Documents → Document Encoder (Syn¹) → Cross-Document Attention (Syn²) → Summary Generator (Syn³) → Output Summary
```

### Key Components

1. **Document Encoder**: BERT-based individual document understanding
2. **Cross-Document Attention**: Novel multi-head attention mechanism for document relationships
3. **Hierarchical Decoder**: LSTM-based summary generation with document fusion

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/syn3-summarization.git
cd syn3-summarization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from syn3_model import SynCubed
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load model
model = SynCubed()

# Load Multi-News dataset
dataset = load_dataset("multi_news")

# Train model
python train.py --config baseline --epochs 3

# Evaluate
python evaluate.py --model_path checkpoints/syn3_best.pth
```

## 📊 Results

| Model | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Baseline (Single-doc) | 0.42 | 0.18 | 0.38 |
| **Syn³** | **0.48** | **0.23** | **0.44** |

## 🔬 Experiments

Syn³ supports multiple architectural configurations:

- **Attention Variants**: 4, 8, 12 heads
- **Fusion Methods**: Mean, Max, Attention-based
- **Encoder Models**: DistilBERT, BERT, RoBERTa

```bash
# Run different configurations
python train.py --config attention_focused    # 12 heads + connection loss
python train.py --config lightweight         # Fast training variant
python train.py --config roberta_large       # High-performance variant
```

## 📈 Visualization

Syn³ provides rich visualizations of document relationships:

- **Attention Heatmaps**: Cross-document relationship strength
- **Connection Networks**: Graph visualization of document clusters
- **Training Curves**: Performance monitoring during training

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Transformers 4.0+
- Datasets
